# Text compressor

I have programmed a simple text compressor based on [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) for my first semester cs course.

The code and its structure may be a bit messy, as the project was done in a few days.

The project is documented on its respective github website, available below.

[Find it on github](https://github.com/Gabirodz/tcomp)
