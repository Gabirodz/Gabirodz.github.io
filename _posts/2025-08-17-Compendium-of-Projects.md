#Compendium of Projects

In this post I include many (not all!) of the projects I worked on during my undergrad at the University of Guanajuato. Be aware that citation
and referencing may be lackluster especially in earlier projects, so these documents should only be taken as a reference of the curriculum I studied alongside a guide to my personal interests,
rather than actual pieces of academic value.

## My graduation work

This is my graduation project, an Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, and the Quantum Hall effect. It is not a thesis, simply an introductory work. Being a major in Mathematics, I considered my Physics knowledge
very lackluster to try to make a proper thesis at the level and covering the topics I wanted it to. I believe I will be able to produce
a more relevant, this time original work for my Master's degree with a much strengthened Physics knowledge.

## My final project for Differential Topology.

It's an introduction to Einstein's Special Relativity. Admittedly, I didn't use much of the tools from the class in this project and remains largely introductory. But it is a nice project
because I decided to go all the way back to the very basics and transition to higher level mathematics from there, albeit a lot more work needed
to be done to see the full purpose of this transition. Around this time is when I decided I wanted to work in Mathematical Physics.

## Mathematical Analysis projects.

The projects I worked on for my Mathematical Analysis I and II classes.

First, an analytical proof of Brouwer's theorem on the Invariance of Domain. We pass from topological to analytical properties using the classic
approximation theory. Roughly following a Terence Tao's blog post on this matter.

Now, an introduction to variational inequalities. I wanted to extend further into Sobolev spaces but didn't have the available time to do so.
Roughly following Haim Brezis' textbook.

## Epidemiology summer stay

Here I discovered epidemiology is not my cup of tea, but I learned valuable lessons. I tried to study reinfection models.

## Probability project

The final project of my Probability course, it is a formal proof of the Strong Law of Large Numbers. I don't remember which textbooks we followed.
