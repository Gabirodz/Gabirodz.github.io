# About me

## Personal info
My full name is **Axel Gabriel Rodriguez Zarate**. I was born in Mexico City, in the year 2003.

I moved from Mexico City to Guanajuato to study for my undergraduate degree in the mathematics department of the University of Guanajuato.

Secondary interests and hobbies of mine include chess, videogames, technology, operating systems and geopolitics.

## Education

* Bachelor's degree in Mathematics (2021 - 2026) - ongoing
  * University of Guanajuato, jointly with Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas.

## Academic interests

My education in mathematics is general and basic at the moment, as made precise in the **Skills** section. 

I have not specialized nor have working knowledge in any of the topics mentioned ahead, yet.

My main academic interests for the future currently are:
* Functional analysis and PDEs
* Differential geometry
* Relativity theory (and to a less extent other topics in mathematical physics)

## Skills
### Computer programming

I learned basic programming during high school. Some of the tools I used during this time for small personal projects were:

* Web Application programming with PHP Laravel.
* General programming with Java.
* Windows 10 application programming with .NET, C#.
* Mobile Videogame programming with Unity.
* Android app programming in Android Studio, Java.

More recently, during my undergrad I've programmed with:
* C and C++
* Python

I've referred to two small projects I made for my CS class and my Numerical Methods class in this website.

I have used extensively and feel comfortable utilizing  **Linux-based operating systems**.

### Mathematics

My education is in mathematics. 

* I can understand and propose solutions to mathematical problems.

* I can understand mathematical proofs and prove elementary results on my own.

While I lean more towards pure mathematics, I feel confident in my ability to understand and work with more applied problems.

Relevant classes I've completed succesfully along with the main bibliography used during the class are:
* Abstract algebra I
	*  Algebra from Larry C. Grove (Group theory and Ring theory)
* Topology I 
	* Topology from James Munkres (General topology)
* Complex Analysis I
	* Complex Variables and Applications by Brown (up to and including Laurent Series)
* Calculus III & IV
	* Calculus on Manifolds by Spivak (up to and including Stokes' theorem)
* Mathematical Analysis I & II
	* Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin, among others.
* Partial Differential Equations I
	* Partial Differential Equations by Hillen (Second order linear PDEs, method of characteristics, separation of variables)
* Probability I & II
	* A Probability Path by Resnick, among others (Basic measure and integration theory, Laplace and Fourier transform, types and theorems of convergence of sequences of r.v.s, other important theorems in probability)


### Other abilities

* Fluent conversational English.
* Good communication and writing.
* Problem solving.
* Fast learner.
* Accostumed with technology and reading documentation to learn new technologies.
